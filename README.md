Seat Belt Detection
This repository contains code for Seat Belt Detection using YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv9 as part of an image processing course. The project aims to evaluate the performance of different YOLO versions on a consistent dataset and compare their variations.

Introduction
Seat belt detection is crucial for ensuring road safety. By employing computer vision techniques, we can automatically detect the presence or absence of seat belts in images, aiding in enforcing safety regulations and promoting awareness among drivers and passengers.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of annotated images containing various scenarios with seat belts. This curated dataset ensures consistency across different YOLO model evaluations. You can access and download the dataset from here.

Branch: Main
Description
The main branch serves as the primary branch of the project, containing stable and tested code. It provides a baseline implementation of the seat belt detection system using YOLOv5 as the default model.

Usage
To use the code from the main branch:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/HayaAbdullahM/Seat-Belt-Detection.git
Install the necessary dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the seat belt detection system.
