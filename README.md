# Seat Belt Detection

This repository contains code for Seat Belt Detection using YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv9 as part of an image processing course. The project aims to evaluate the performance of different YOLO versions on a consistent dataset and compare their variations.

## Introduction

Seat belt detection is crucial for ensuring road safety. By employing computer vision techniques, we can automatically detect the presence or absence of seat belts in images, aiding in enforcing safety regulations and promoting awareness among drivers and passengers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of annotated images containing various scenarios with seat belts. This curated dataset ensures consistency across different YOLO model evaluations. You can access and download the dataset from [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/fay-regu8/seat_belt-iauiy).
